# Hi there. I'm Eduard Pysanka, a frontend developerðŸ‘‹

## About me
I started learning WordPress (PHP) and even created a website using wp- rocket, custom fields, galleries, form processing, and a blog page with search functionality. However, I later realized that React is more promising and interesting, so I switched to learning it. Now I have knowledge of React and its ecosystem (Redux, React-router-dom, TypeScript, etc.), which I have demonstrated in my pet projects. Currently learning Next.js and Node.js.
